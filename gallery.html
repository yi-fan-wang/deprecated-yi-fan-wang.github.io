                                    <br><em>How I Determined to do Cosmology</em>  </br>
                                    <br>&nbsp &nbsp It all begins with Ancient Greece...
                                    <br>&nbsp &nbsp As a little girl, I stared at the night sky wandering those questions which Ancient Greek had also asked, "What are we?", "Why are we here?"... I decided to be an "Astronomer" so that I can answer these questions in the future.  
                                    <br>&nbsp &nbsp Before I went to primary school, I started to be interested in creatures, I thought that non-living things were not worth study, and I was so afraid of death, so I decided to be a "Biologist" in the future, once I figured out all problems of creatures, I figured out everything! I thought.
                                    <br>&nbsp &nbsp Thanks to the science books for kids, I entered the Age of Enlightenment. I read about Newton's Gravitational Laws and laws of motion, and knew that everything is made of atoms. I learned the terminology "physics" and realized how ignorant I was. I decided to be a physicist in the future and thought that I was smart enough to become someone like Newton. 
                                    <br>&nbsp &nbsp I read A. Zee's popular science book <b><i>"Einstein's Universe"</i></b> at 14. I would rate this book as the one that has the hugest influence on me. I'm so astonished by the elegance and beauty of Einstein's theory of gravity that I made up my mind to become a theoretical physicsist and study the evolution of the Universe and natural laws govern it.
                                    <br>&nbsp &nbsp This is my “pre-college” history. The road to become a cosmologist is more difficult than I used to thought, and I'm less smart than I used to thought, nor does anyone. As A. Zee quote in his book：<i>Man thinks; God laughs</i>. but I still have the courage and passion to carry on my journey to revealing the laws of nature，because it is worth fighting for.
