                              <br><em>Superconducting Cosmic Strings as Sources of Fast Radio Bursts</em>  </br>
                                <br>Cosmic strings are one kind of topological defects generated during early universe phase transition eras when a U(1) symmetry is broken. Superconducting strings (SCS) proposed by Witten can be realized by a charged scalar field whose flux is trapped in normal cosmic strings, with the electromagnetic gauge invariance broken inside the strings. The electromagnetic properties of strings are very similar to superconducting wires. Electromagnetic radiations emitted from SCSs can be produced by oscillation of strings. Such emissions are significantly enhanced by structures on strings such as cusps—where part of the string starts turning back and has a temporal phase speed of light—and kink discontinuities. In our work, we used an order-of-magnitude method to derive the electromagnetic power emitted from three kinds of structures of SCSs.</br>
                                <br>So far, 18 fast radio burst (FRB) events has been detected by the Parkes, Arecibo and GBT telescopes. These events are characterized as having a bandwidth of millisecond scale, and frequency around GHz scale. All these events show extragalactic origins and are within z = 1.4. The flux of these events are about several Jys. A number of models have made attempts on explaining FRB sources, including SCSs. we considered the scatterings effects from interstellar medium (ISM) and intergalactic medium (IGM) and used our model to fit the observed FRB data, thus to constrain the parameter space of SCSs. Our work provided a procedure of testing SCS as the potential sources of FRBs, which can be an effective reference for future FRB observations.

                              <br><em>ILLUSTRIS and Galaxy-Halo Velocity Bias</em>  </br>
                                <br>Galaxies are known to be biased tracers of the underlying dark matter in the universe. Although the spatial distribution of galaxies differs from that of the dark matter, we can still infer the dark matter distribution and constrain the cosmological parameters from galaxy clustering measurements by carefully taking into account the galaxy bias. A similar effect could also exist in the galaxy peculiar velocity field, i.e., the galaxies may not exactly follow the dark matter velocity field, resulting in a "velocity bias".</br>
                                <br>Previous work show that there are two potential physical scenarios to explain central galaxy velocity bias, either the central galaxy is not relaxed in a virialized halo (referred to as the non-relaxed galaxy scenario) or the central galaxy is relaxed at the halo potential minimum while the halo itself is not relaxed (referred to as the non-relaxed halo scenario). In reality, both of these scenarios may play a role in the measured velocity bias, as the mergers between central and satellite galaxies and those between different halos could both affect the velocity bias. Given the importance of the constraining power of the galaxy peculiar velocity field in cosmology, we used the state-of-art high-resolution hydrodynamical simulation <a href="http://www.illustris-project.org/"  target="_blank">ILLUSTRIS</a> to understand the origin of the galaxy velocity bias, and its dependence on various galaxy and halo parameters, which could provide better parameterization and more accurate modeling of galaxy velocity bias and aid the intepretation of the measurements in the real universe.</br>
                                <br>We confirmed the existence of galaxy velocity bias for both central and satellite galaxies. We find that the values of central and satellite galaxy velocity bias decrease with the ratio between galaxy stellar mass and host halo mass. Other dependence relations such as galaxy and halo age has also been discussed. By following the evolution of a certain halo sample, we discussed the origin of velocity bias and the dependence relations.</br>

                              <br><em>Proto-planetary Disk Winds</em>  </br>
                                <br>The mechanism of winds launched from magnetized disks has been studied for decades, such processes are governed by magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). In our work, we proposed a 1D model of MHD disk winds from weakly ionized protoplanetary disks (PPDs). We aim to unite the two scenarios of PPD mass loss into a joint theoretical framework, which we coin magneto-photoevaporation or magneto-thermal winds, since both magnetic and thermal effect play a major role in wind launching and kinematics.</br>
                                <br>As shown in the schematic illustration at top left figure, we considered a disk with a non-zero thickness. Wind launching takes place in the disk surface that is well ionized by radiation, the magnetic line based on where wind is launched has a certain configuration. Wind launched from the disk surface follows a set of conservation laws. Given certain thermodynamic conditions, we would have a non-zero sound speed in our model. As a result, additional constraints must be satisfied for a smooth solution. Top right figure shows the contours of the energy function for a correct solution, we can see that the wind has passed through three critical points respectively. We discussed the radial profiles of various wind diagnostic quantities and force decomposition for three representative wind solutions as well as other properties of solutions for different parameter spaces such as wind thermodynamics, magnetic field line divergence, field geometry etc. in detail. Our results suggest that due to the dominant role played by magnetic fields in wind launching and acceleration, PPDs likely lose mass more quickly than previously thought (from pure photoevaporation), and reach a considerable fraction of the wind-driven accretion rate.</br>
